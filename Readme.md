# CryptoCurrency Price Prediction

Blockchain technology is a decentralized database system that was first implemented by Bitcoin. Created by a mysterious person (or group), Blockchain has a very high tendency to transform modern day business operation models. As Bitcoin gains more traction, people keep coming up with alternate coins that are also based on Blockchain technology.

The goal is to find a model where we can predit the value of Cryptocoin considering all the factors which influences the price.

## Getting Started

The best way to understand this project is to read the files in the following order:
    a.  Analyze other cryptocurrencies to see if there's a correlation (CompareCoins.ipynb)
    b.  Analyze Reddit Metrics(Reddit Metrics.ipynb)
    c.  Analyze Google trends(Google trends.ipynb)
    d.  Analyze Stock Market Prices(Stock Market.ipynb)
    e.  Analyze Commodity Prices(Commodity.ipynb)
    f.  Analyze Oil Prices(Oil Prices.ipynb)
    g.  Analyze BTC-ETH EDA (Bitcoin_EDA)

### Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

### Data Sources:
1. CryptoCompare (cryptocompare.com)
2. Quandl (Quand.com)
3. Google Trends using Pytrends API
4. Twitter data using API
5. Stock Market Prices (finance.yahoo.com)
6. Commodity Prices (kitco.com)
7. Oil Prices (eia.gov)
8. Reddit Metrics (redditmetrics.com)



And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
