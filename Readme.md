# CryptoCurrency Price Prediction

Blockchain technology is a decentralized database system that was first implemented by Bitcoin. Created by a mysterious person (or group), Blockchain has a very high tendency to transform modern day business operation models. As Bitcoin gains more traction, people keep coming up with alternate coins that are also based on Blockchain technology.

The goal is to find a model where we can predit the value of Cryptocoin considering all the factors which influences the price.
